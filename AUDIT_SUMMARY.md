- **Functionality**: Core meal planning works, recipe browsing problematic

## Immediate Action Plan (Next 7 Days)

### Priority 1: Critical Fixes
1. **Recipe Page Performance**: 
   - Implement progressive loading for recipe data
   - Add pagination instead of loading all 455 recipes at once
   - Optimize bundle size and lazy loading

2. **Authentication Demo Mode**:
   - Add guest/demo user functionality
   - Allow evaluation without full signup process
   - Implement basic user session management

3. **Loading State Implementation**:
   - Add spinners for meal plan generation
   - Implement skeleton loading states
   - Add success/error notifications

### Priority 2: UX Improvements
1. **Mobile Touch Targets**: Increase button sizes to 44px+ minimum
2. **Error Messages**: Implement specific, actionable error feedback
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Fix metrics collection and display

## Expected Outcomes After Fixes
