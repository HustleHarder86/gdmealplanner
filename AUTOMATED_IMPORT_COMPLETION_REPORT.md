```

## 📈 Campaign Management

### 20-Day Import Schedule ✅

- **Phase 1 (Days 1-10)**: Core library - 1,000 popular recipes
- **Phase 2 (Days 11-15)**: Dietary variations - 500 specialized recipes
- **Phase 3 (Days 16-20)**: Seasonal & international - 500 diverse recipes

### 7-Day Rotation Pattern ✅

- **Days 1-2**: Breakfast focus (40-60 recipes/day)
- **Days 3-4**: Main meals (30 lunch + 30 dinner/day)
- **Days 5-6**: Snacks (40-60 recipes/day)
- **Day 7**: Gap filling (20 per category)
