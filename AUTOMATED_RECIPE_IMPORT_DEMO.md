# Automated Recipe Import System - Complete Implementation

## System Overview

The automated recipe import system has been successfully implemented and is ready for deployment. This system imports 100 GD-compliant recipes daily from the Spoonacular API over a 20-day campaign, with intelligent filtering, quality validation, and categorization.

## ‚úÖ Components Implemented

### 1. Core Import Service (`/src/services/spoonacular/automated-import/`)

- **Import Strategies** (`import-strategies.ts`): 7-day rotating schedule with 20+ different strategies
- **Quality Validator** (`quality-validator.ts`): 0-100 point scoring system with GD compliance, practicality, and popularity metrics  
- **Recipe Deduplicator** (`deduplicator.ts`): Advanced duplicate detection using fingerprinting and fuzzy matching
- **Auto-categorizer** (`categorizer.ts`): ML-style categorization based on nutrition, keywords, and preparation
- **Reporter** (`reporter.ts`): Comprehensive daily and weekly reporting with actionable insights
- **Scheduler** (`scheduler.ts`): Main orchestration class managing the entire import process

### 2. Import Strategies Configuration

**20-Day Campaign Structure:**
- **Phase 1 (Days 1-10)**: Core library - popular, well-rated recipes  
- **Phase 2 (Days 11-15)**: Dietary variations - vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free
- **Phase 3 (Days 16-20)**: Seasonal & special - international cuisines, batch cooking

**7-Day Rotating Schedule:**
- Days 1-2: Breakfast focus (40-60 recipes/day)
- Days 3-4: Main meals (30 lunch + 30 dinner/day) 
- Days 5-6: Snacks (40-60 recipes/day)
- Day 7: Gap filling (20 per category)

## ‚úÖ Features Implemented

- **Popularity (30 pts)**: Spoonacular rating, number of reviews

### Deduplication System
- Exact Spoonacular ID matching
- Normalized title comparison  
- Fuzzy ingredient matching
- Recipe variant detection
- Nutritional profile similarity

### Auto-categorization
- Nutrition profile analysis
- Keyword matching
- Ingredient pattern recognition
- Cooking time and complexity factors

### Comprehensive Reporting

## üöÄ How to Use the System

### 1. Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```bash
# Required
SPOONACULAR_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# Optional
CAMPAIGN_START_DATE=2024-01-01
NOTIFICATION_WEBHOOK=https://your-webhook-url.com
```

### 2. Run Daily Import

```bash
# Execute the daily import (designed for cron jobs)
npm run import:daily
```

### 3. Test the System

```bash
# Run comprehensive test suite
npm run test-import

# Run test with actual API import (limited to 10 recipes)
npm run test-import -- --import
```

### 4. Manual Import with Custom Strategies

```typescript
import { RecipeImportScheduler } from './src/services/spoonacular/automated-import';

const scheduler = new RecipeImportScheduler(process.env.SPOONACULAR_API_KEY);

// Custom strategy example
const customStrategy = {
  name: "High Fiber Breakfast",
  description: "Import high fiber breakfast recipes",
  filters: {
    query: "breakfast oats fiber",
    minFiber: 8,
    maxCarbs: 30,
    minProtein: 10,
  },
  targetCount: 20,
  priority: 1,
};

const report = await scheduler.manualImport(customStrategy, 20);
console.log(formatReportForDisplay(report));
```

## üìä System Performance

- **GD Compliance Rate**: 90%+ target
- **Quality Score Average**: 70+ target
- **Duplicate Rate**: <5% target
- **API Efficiency**: ~2-3 recipes per API call

## üìà Monitoring & Reporting

### Daily Reports Include:
- Import summary (recipes imported, rejected, API usage)
- Category breakdown with quality scores
- GD compliance metrics
- Top performing recipes
- Actionable recommendations

### Report Storage:
- JSON reports: `/reports/imports/YYYY-MM-DD-session-id.json`
