# Complete Recipe Audit Report

## Executive Summary

Your application has **two separate recipe datasets**:

1. **Active Dataset** (48 recipes) - Located in `/data/recipes/` - **CURRENTLY IN USE**
2. **Unused Dataset** (360 recipes) - Located in `/scripts/recipe-scraper/output-full/` - **NOT IN USE**

## Dataset Analysis

### 1. Active Dataset (48 recipes) - ✅ Already Cleaned

- **Location**: `/data/recipes/`
- **Status**: Currently being used by the application
- **Verification Results**:
  - 1 real recipe with valid URL (Mediterranean Chicken Pita)
  - 47 recipes now properly marked as "created for this app"
  - All fake URLs have been removed
  - Source attribution added to all recipes

### 2. Unused Dataset (360 recipes) - ❌ 100% Fake

- **Location**: `/scripts/recipe-scraper/output-full/`
- **Status**: NOT imported or used by the application
- **Analysis Results**:
  - **100% programmatically generated** using templates
  - Pattern: "[Style] [Base] with [Addition1] and [Addition2]"
  - Contains nonsensical combinations (e.g., smoothies with olive oil)
  - 75% of recipes share identical instructions
  - No real recipe URLs - all are fake

## Key Findings

### The Good News

✅ Your application is using the smaller, cleaner dataset
✅ I've already removed fake URLs from the active dataset
✅ All active recipes now have proper source attribution
✅ The 360 fake recipes are NOT being used

### The Recipe Generation Methods

**Method 1: Python Scraper (`scraper.py`)**

- Designed to scrape real recipes
- Produced the 48 recipes currently in use
- Only 1 was actually from diabetesfoodhub.org

**Method 2: JavaScript Generator (`scraper-full.js`)**

- Generated 360 completely fake recipes
- Used template combinations:
  - 10 cuisine styles × 10 base items × various additions
  - Resulted in absurd combinations
  - All have generic, identical instructions

## Current Application Status

The recipe service (`/lib/recipe-service.ts`) imports from:

```typescript
import recipesData from "@/scripts/recipe-scraper/data/recipes/recipes.json";
import breakfastData from "@/scripts/recipe-scraper/data/recipes/breakfast.json";
import lunchData from "@/scripts/recipe-scraper/data/recipes/lunch.json";
import dinnerData from "@/scripts/recipe-scraper/data/recipes/dinner.json";
import snacksData from "@/scripts/recipe-scraper/data/recipes/snacks.json";
```

These files contain the 48 cleaned recipes, NOT the 360 fake ones.

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Already Complete ✅)

1. ✅ Removed fake URLs from active recipes
2. ✅ Added source attribution ("created" vs "original")
3. ✅ Fixed ingredient lists to show raw ingredients

### Future Improvements

1. **Delete the unused 360 recipes** - They serve no purpose and are misleading
2. **Get real recipes** - Partner with recipe sites or nutritionists
3. **Quality control** - Have recipes reviewed by dietitians specializing in GD

## Summary

Your application is currently using 48 recipes that have been cleaned and properly attributed. The 360 programmatically generated recipes exist in your codebase but are NOT being used. All fake URLs have been removed from the active dataset, and recipes are now transparently marked as "created for gestational diabetes meal planning."
