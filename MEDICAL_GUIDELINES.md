## Blood Glucose Targets

**Official targets for diabetes in pregnancy:**

| Time of Day | Target Level |
|------------|--------------|
| **Fasting** | Less than 5.3 mmol/L |
| **1 hour after meal** | Less than 7.8 mmol/L |
| **2 hours after meal** | Less than 6.7 mmol/L |

## Blood Glucose Monitoring Requirements

- Check blood glucose **4 times daily**
- Record all blood glucose levels on record sheet
- Check fasting glucose (first thing in morning before eating)
- Check 2 hours after meals (test 2 hours after first bite)
- Occasionally may check 1 hour after meal instead of 2 hours

## Nutrition Principles

### Carbohydrate Foods (Increase Blood Glucose)
- Grains and starches
- Fruits
- Milk and alternatives
- Other choices (sweets, jam, sugary drinks, honey)

### Non-Carbohydrate Foods (Little/No Impact on Blood Glucose)
- Non-starchy vegetables (provide vitamins, minerals, fiber)
- Meat and alternatives (provide protein)
- Fats and oils (provide fat)

### Key Principles
- A healthy diet includes balance from all food groups
- Carbohydrates are necessary during pregnancy
- Eating too much carbohydrate raises blood glucose
- Eating too little could affect healthy growth of baby
- Plan meals and snacks, spreading carbohydrates over the day
- Select lower glycemic index (GI) choices

## Medical Management

### Insulin
- Some women need insulin if healthy eating and physical activity aren't enough
- Insulin does not hurt the baby
- Needing insulin doesn't mean failure - it means body has high insulin resistance
- Insulin requirements may increase as pregnancy progresses
- After pregnancy, insulin may no longer be required

## Follow-up Care
- Regular prenatal visits with physician or midwife
- Appointments with diabetes team
- Record meals, snacks, blood glucose values, and physical activity

## Carbohydrate Guidelines for Meals and Snacks

**Recommended carbohydrate amounts at meals and snacks:**

| Time | Carbohydrate (grams) | Carbohydrate Choices |
|------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Breakfast** | 30 g | 2 |
| **Snack** | 15-30 g | 1-2 |
| **Lunch** | 45 g | 3 |
| **Snack** | 15-30 g | 1-2 |
| **Supper** | 45 g | 3 |
| **Bedtime Snack** | 15 g + protein | 1 + protein |

### How to Balance Carbohydrates Through the Day

- Enjoy three meals and three snacks spaced evenly throughout the day
- Eating the suggested amount of carbohydrates in your meals and snacks
- Limit foods high in added sugar

### Daily Nutrition Guidelines

In your daily choices, include:
- 3 servings of fruit per day
- 3 servings of milk/milk alternatives per day
- Choose fibre-rich sources of carbohydrates like whole grain breads and cereals, and legumes and lentils. Fibre slows carbohydrate absorption into your blood
- Choose vegetables and fruit rather than juice
