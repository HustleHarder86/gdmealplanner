## Blood Glucose Targets

**Official targets for diabetes in pregnancy:**

| Time of Day            | Target Level         |
| ---------------------- | -------------------- |
| **Fasting**            | Less than 5.3 mmol/L |
| **1 hour after meal**  | Less than 7.8 mmol/L |
| **2 hours after meal** | Less than 6.7 mmol/L |

## Blood Glucose Monitoring Requirements

- Check blood glucose **4 times daily**
- Record all blood glucose levels on record sheet
- Check fasting glucose (first thing in morning before eating)
- Check 2 hours after meals (test 2 hours after first bite)
- Occasionally may check 1 hour after meal instead of 2 hours

## Nutrition Principles

### Carbohydrate Foods (Increase Blood Glucose)

- Grains and starches
- Fruits
- Milk and alternatives
- Other choices (sweets, jam, sugary drinks, honey)

### Non-Carbohydrate Foods (Little/No Impact on Blood Glucose)

- Non-starchy vegetables (provide vitamins, minerals, fiber)
- Meat and alternatives (provide protein)
- Fats and oils (provide fat)

### Key Principles

- A healthy diet includes balance from all food groups
- Carbohydrates are necessary during pregnancy
- Eating too much carbohydrate raises blood glucose
- Eating too little could affect healthy growth of baby
- Plan meals and snacks, spreading carbohydrates over the day
- Select lower glycemic index (GI) choices

## Medical Management

### Insulin

- Some women need insulin if healthy eating and physical activity aren't enough
- Insulin does not hurt the baby
- Needing insulin doesn't mean failure - it means body has high insulin resistance
- Insulin requirements may increase as pregnancy progresses
- After pregnancy, insulin may no longer be required

## Follow-up Care

- Regular prenatal visits with physician or midwife
- Appointments with diabetes team
- Record meals, snacks, blood glucose values, and physical activity

## Carbohydrate Guidelines for Meals and Snacks

**Recommended carbohydrate amounts at meals and snacks:**

| Time              | Carbohydrate (grams) | Carbohydrate Choices |
| ----------------- | -------------------- | -------------------- |
| **Breakfast**     | 30 g                 | 2                    |
| **Snack**         | 15-30 g              | 1-2                  |
| **Lunch**         | 45 g                 | 3                    |
| **Snack**         | 15-30 g              | 1-2                  |
| **Supper**        | 45 g                 | 3                    |
| **Bedtime Snack** | 15 g + protein       | 1 + protein          |

### How to Balance Carbohydrates Through the Day

- Enjoy three meals and three snacks spaced evenly throughout the day
- Eating the suggested amount of carbohydrates in your meals and snacks
- Limit foods high in added sugar

### Daily Nutrition Guidelines

In your daily choices, include:

- 3 servings of fruit per day
- 3 servings of milk/milk alternatives per day
- Choose fibre-rich sources of carbohydrates like whole grain breads and cereals, and legumes and lentils. Fibre slows carbohydrate absorption into your blood
- Choose vegetables and fruit rather than juice

## Carbohydrate Portions

### What is a Carbohydrate?

Carbohydrates affect blood glucose levels more than other nutrients. They include:

- **Grains & Starches**: bread, rice, pasta, potatoes, cereal
- **Fruit & Fruit Juice**
- **Milk & Yogurt**
- **Legumes**: lentils, beans
- **Sweets & Desserts**
- **Vegetables**: small amounts (3-5g per serving)

### Quick Reference

- **1 Choice = 15g carbohydrate**
- **Read nutrition labels** for accurate carb counting
- **"Net carbs" are NOT used** in Canada

### Grains & Starches (15g carb portions)

- 1 slice bread
- 1/2 English muffin, hamburger bun, or 6" pita
- 1/3 cup cooked rice or quinoa
- 1/2 cup cooked pasta
- 3/4 cup cold cereal
- 1/2 cup cooked oatmeal
- 1/2 medium potato
- 1/2 cup corn
- 6 soda crackers

### Milk & Alternatives (15g carb portions)

- 1 cup milk or soy beverage
- 3/4 cup plain yogurt
- 1/2 cup chocolate milk

### Fruit (15g carb portions)

- 1 medium apple, orange, pear, peach
- 2 small plums, kiwis, or clementines
- 1/2 banana
- 1 cup berries or melon
- 2 tbsp raisins
- 1/2 cup unsweetened juice

### Non-Starchy Vegetables (free foods)

Eat as desired:

- Leafy greens, broccoli, cauliflower
- Peppers, tomatoes, cucumber
- Asparagus, celery, mushrooms

## Meal Plate Method

### Balanced Plate Composition

- **1/2 plate**: Non-starchy vegetables
- **1/4 plate**: Protein (meat, fish, eggs, tofu)
- **1/4 plate**: Grains & starches
- **Add**: Fruit and milk/alternatives as per meal plan
- **Use**: Small amounts of healthy fats

## Healthy Eating Guidelines

### Key Principles

1. **Space carbohydrates** throughout the day
2. **Combine carbs with protein** at each meal/snack
3. **Choose high-fiber options** (slows glucose rise)
4. **Limit juice** to 1/2 cup if blood glucose is low
5. **Avoid sugary drinks** and fruit juice
6. **Include protein** at bedtime snack

### Protein Foods (minimal carbs)

- Meat, poultry, fish
- Eggs
- Cheese
- Nuts and seeds (1/4 cup)
- Tofu

### Foods to Limit/Avoid

- Sugar-sweetened beverages
- Candy and sweets
- Honey, syrups, jams
- Regular desserts
- Fruit juice (unless treating low blood glucose)

## Special Considerations

### Morning Carbohydrate Sensitivity

- Blood glucose often highest in the morning
- May need to limit breakfast carbs more strictly
- Consider lower glycemic index choices

### Restaurant Meals

- Order dressings/sauces on the side
- Choose grilled over fried
- Request substitutions (salad for fries)
- Control portions (take half home)

### Nutrition Label Reading

1. Check serving size first
2. Look at total carbohydrates (not sugars alone)
3. Include all carb sources in your count
4. Fiber is included in total carbs in Canada

## Daily Record Format

### Blood Glucose Monitoring Sheet

Track the following daily:

- **Date**
- **Fasting glucose** (before breakfast)
- **2 hours after breakfast**
- **2 hours after lunch**
- **2 hours after dinner**
- **Additional tests** if needed
- **Comments** (illness, stress, unusual activity)

### How to Balance Carbohydrates Through the Day

- Aim for 3 balanced meals + 3 snacks
- Never skip meals
- Space meals 4-6 hours apart
- Include snacks between meals if needed
- Always have bedtime snack with protein

## Understanding Gestational Diabetes

### What Happens During Pregnancy

1. **Placenta hormones** increase insulin resistance
2. **Pancreas** needs to produce 2-3x more insulin
3. If pancreas can't keep up, blood glucose rises
4. **GD typically develops** around 24-28 weeks
5. **Goes away** after delivery in most cases

### Risk Factors

- Previous GD or large baby (>4kg)
- Family history of diabetes
- BMI ≥30
- Age ≥35
- Certain ethnic backgrounds
- PCOS

### Why Control Matters

High blood glucose can cause:

- Large baby (increased cesarean risk)
- Low blood glucose in baby after birth
- Breathing problems for baby
- Higher risk of obesity/diabetes for child later
