## Implications

1. **Data Integrity Issue**: 97.9% of the recipes have fake URLs, which could mislead users who expect to find the original recipes on diabetesfoodhub.org.

2. **User Experience Impact**: Users clicking on recipe links will encounter 404 errors for nearly all recipes.

3. **SEO Concerns**: Linking to non-existent pages can negatively impact SEO and user trust.

## Recommendations

1. **Remove External URLs**: Since most URLs are fake, consider removing the URL field entirely from recipes that don't have valid external sources.

2. **Find Real URLs**: For recipes that should link to diabetesfoodhub.org, find the actual URLs for these recipes if they exist.

3. **Create Internal Recipe Pages**: Instead of linking externally, create dedicated recipe pages within your application.

4. **Use Different Sources**: Consider scraping from recipe sources that have more reliable URLs, or partner with recipe providers.

5. **Add URL Validation**: Implement URL validation in your recipe scraper to prevent fake URLs from being saved.

- **Rate Limiting**: 100ms delay between requests to be respectful to the server
- **Concurrent Workers**: 3 threads for faster processing
- **User Agent**: Standard browser user agent to avoid blocking
