Cook until the artichoke hearts are warmed through, then remove from pan to a bowl and set aside.2 In a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs and the cottage cheese. In a small bowl, whisk together the flour, Parmesan, and baking powder.",

Note that the color of the mixture may change, don't worry if this happens, it will go back to normal when cooked. 3 Wipe out the pan with a paper towel. Then melt another tablespoon of butter into the pan on medium heat, and swirl along the bottom and sides to coat well.",
        "4. Pour the egg mixture into the pan, swirling to make sure the artichokes and leeks are evenly distributed. Lower the heat. Cover the pan, slowly cook on the stove top for 12 to 15 minutes, until all but the center has set. You'll need to check every few minutes. The heat should be high enough to set the mixture, but low enough so that the edges don't brown. This frittata benefits from slow, gentle cooking. 4",
        "5. Place rack in upper third of oven. Preheat the broiler. When the frittata is mostly set, except for the center which is still wiggly, place the pan in the oven. Broil for 3 to 4 minutes until the top is lightly browned and the center has set.5",
        "6. Remove pan from oven. (Be careful about the hot handle! Use a pot holder. I like to run an ice cube over the handle to to be extra safe.) Use a blunt knife or a metal spatula to loosen the edges of the frittata from the pan. Gently insert the spatula under the frittata to loosen it from the bottom of the pan. Then gently slide the frittata onto a serving plate.",

I begin with my bacon (Ive never had bacon this fresh before, from an entirely organic source so close to home that my husband is literally feeding next seasons pork belly), which I chop and try out to nice crispy cubelets.  Now the rest of the meal will take less than 25 minutes: 10 minutes to boil the pasta, make the sauce, and assemble the dish (and, if youre like me, some sub-urb biscuits), and 15 minutes to bake it (while you make  a quick salad).  So be ready.",
        "2. I melt my butter in my wok over high heat.  I throw my pasta nests into the salted boiling water on the back burner.",
        "3. When my butter is melted and just begging to tan, I add my heavy cream and blend well.  I bring this to a simmer for a moment.",
        "4. Then I add 3/4 of my cheese, which Ive shredded. (The rest I will thinly shave for a final garnish.)",
        "5. I blend this well, bringing it to a low simmer to thicken, until it forms a smooth sauce.  I also add some salt and pepper.  (Crushed red pepper flakes, nutmeg, paprika, maybe even a dash of curry powder would work nicely here, too.)",
        "6. Finally, I add 3/4 of my cooked bacon, and blend well with the sauce, until the flavors are beautifully infused.",
        "7. Its  been 10 minutes, and my 11 minute pasta is just slightly undercooked (I know, cuz I bit off a snippet)  perfect!  Using tongs and a meshed spoon, I transfer my pasta to the waiting bacon cream, and toss well.  I add a tablespoon, maybe, of the pasta water, too, just to keep the sauce wet enough to bake later.",
        "8. Using my tongs, I spin 1/2 of the pasta and sauce into each of two medium (10oz) ceramic ramekins, which Ive brushed down with melted butter.  I sprinkle most of the rest of my bacon (reserving a few chunks for a final flourish) on top.",
        "9. The piece of resistance: a whole, cracked, raw egg, dropped into a wee basket I left in the middle of my pasta and sauce nests.  I manage to keep the yolk whole only in one, but the other I rather hold together by virtue of a cleverly placed noodle and some dribbled sauce.  I place these into a 350 oven to bake for 15 minutes, or until the whites have set, but the yolk is still glossy and runny.",
        "10. After coring the best bits out of a loaf of bread destined for nothing (since my husband purchased a fresher loaf of preferred pan this afternoon) with a properly sized wine-glass rim, I brushed each disk with melted butter, and layered them with some of my sprinkled cheese into 4 cups of a buttered muffin tin, and then I stuck them in my oven along with my pasta nests to brown.  I consider these my sub-urb Wonderbread biscuits: quick, easy, and yummy, leaving fodder for crotons (or compost).  I also threw together a quick salad of baby greens, sliced onion, strips of roasted red peppers, black olives, EVOO, and salt and pepper.  Not that dinner needed these accoutrement  my simmering, saucy noodle nests of runny yolk baked eggs, bac"

        "1. In a food processor, pulse the cauliflower until mostly finely chopped, about 5-7 pulses. (For my recipe, I ended up with 4 1/2 cups of cauliflower.) Melt the butter in a large skillet over med-high heat.",
        "2. Add the cauliflower and 1/2 t. salt. When you hear the cauliflower begin to sizzle, cover the skillet and cook for about 3 minutes, stirring once halfway through. Uncover the skillet and cook another 2 minutes, the cauliflower will be al dente. (If there is liquid pooled in the skillet at all make sure you let it evaporate, I didn't have this problem, but you want the cauliflower to not be wet.)",
        "3. Remove from heat and set aside to cool at least 10 minutes.Meanwhile, preheat oven to 200 degrees. When cauliflower has cooled, add to a large bowl along with minced onion, Parmesan and cheddar cheeses, egg and egg yolk, parsley, paprika, a few grindings of fresh black pepper and panko breadcrumbs.",
        "4. Mix well. If the mixture seems too loose to make patties, add more breadcrumbs, a tablespoon or two at a time until the mix holds together better.Using a measuring cup, scoop out 1/3 c. portions and firmly pat into a patty shape. Set patties aside on a plate. You should have about 8 patties.Wipe out the skillet used to cook the cauliflower.",
        "5. Place back on the burner at medium-high heat.",
        "6. Add 2 T. vegetable oil to the skillet and heat until  the oil starts to shimmer. Carefully lay half the patties in the hot oil and cook until golden brown about 2 minutes per side, being careful that they don't fall apart when you flip them.",
        "7. Remove to a paper towel-lined baking sheet and place into the oven to keep warm. Wipe out the skillet then repeat this step with the remaining oil and cauliflower cakes.",
        "8. Serve hot."

        "4. Place a dollop of butter or a teaspoon of coconut oil in the skillet and spread it around. I suggest making small pancakes because they are much easier to flip when they are small. The flipping process requires some finess, as these pull apart easily  they take a little more care than the standard pancake. Spoon out small portions of batter into the skillet (you should be able to make 3 at a time) and allow pancakes to cook about 5 to 7 minutes before flipping.  Allow pancake to cook an additional 3 minutes and serve with your favorite toppings!Makes about 6 pancakes. Serving size is 3 pancakes per person."

Stick with small to medium-sized pancakes, using a tablespoon or two of batter per pancake (On a 12 skillet, we cook 3 small pancakes at a time). Cook on one side for 5 to 7 minutes and then very carefully work a spatula all the way underneath the pancake to flip it. These pancakes are easy to break. Cook on the other side an additional 3 to 5 minutes until cooked all the way through. Repeat for all of the batter.To Make the Apple Topping:In a small sauce pan, add the chunks of apple and water. Cook on medium heat until juices are seeping out and the contents come to a full boil.",
