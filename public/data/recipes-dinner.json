        "5. Dry off any moisture on your Beef Short Ribs using paper towel.  The meat will brown better and caramelize instead of steam if it is dry.  This browning will produce a lot of flavor in the finished dish.",

        "7. Over medium high add 3 T of Olive Oil to the Bacon Fat and brown all sides of the Short Ribs until they get a good dark brown sear.  Give the Short Ribs room between each other so they do not steam and brown properly.  You will have to do this in 2 to 3 batches to brown all the Short Ribs well.   You will not be cooking through all the way, just browning at this stage.  The Short Ribs will be raw in the middle.",
        "8. Place the first batch after browning in a bowl to catch any drippings.",
        "9. After all the Short Ribs are browned well, remove them from the pot and set aside in the large bowl to collect any drippings as they sit.  Next remove the used Bacon Fat and Olive Oil from the pot leaving any of the cooked on bits stuck to the bottom of the pot.  Reduce the heat to medium and add 3 T of fresh Olive Oil and saute the sliced Mushrooms until browned and crisp. 7-10 minutes.",

As soon as you add the Wine increase the heat to high and stir rapidly, scraping the bottom of the pot releasing the cooked on brown bits stuck to the bottom.  Bring to the boil then add 2 cups of Beef Stock and the Tomato Paste, Beef Base, Thyme, Bay Leaves, Sea Salt and Black Pepper.  Allow to boil, stirring continuously for 3 minutes.",

Use pot holders and place the pot of defatted Sauce over medium high heat and bring to a boil, stirring frequently, and reduce by a third.  This will concentrate the Sauce into a rich incredible Sauce. Taste the Sauce and add Sea Salt and or Black Pepper is needed at this point.  Crumble the Bacon and add to the Sauce stirring in well.",

      "instructions": [
        "1. Buy a nice thick cut of white fish. You can use snapper, dory, kingklip or hake.",
        "2. I like to cut away the belly because its alot thinner in thickness.",
        "3. Cut the steak portion into large chunks. They will shrink when cooked, so dont cut too small a piece.",
        "4. I dont waste the belly parts. I like to roll them up. And then tie the roll of belly fish meat with a single strand of chive, so that it will look as chunky as the rest of the fish meat.",
        "5. Set aside the prepared fish.",
        "6. Prepare the red capsicum. Slice off one end.",
        "7. And then slice off the other end. This will give you a tube. Slide a knife around the inside walls of the red capsicum.",
        "8. Remove the inner seeds and membrane. Slice the hollow tube of red capsicum into half and then slice into thin strips.",
        "9. Grate or mince some peeled ginger to get approximately 1 tablespoon of ginger.",
        "10. Prepare a handful of spices/herbs  2 stalks of lemon grass, 10 lime leaves and a handful of curry leaves.",
        "11. Add 2 tablespoons of cooking oil to a pan.",
        "12. When the oil is hot, add 3 tablespoons of red curry paste of your choice.",
        "13. I always use the A1 brand from Singapore. Find a good curry paste that works for you where you are, and then stock your larder with it!",
        "14. Stir fry the paste in the hot pan for a minute.",
        "15. Add the ginger.",
        "16. Add the garlic. Stir fry well to combine.",
        "17. Add the lemon grass, lime leaves and curry leaves. Stir well to combine.",
        "18. Add 1 tablespoon of tamarind paste. Stir well to combine and dissolve the tamarind.",
        "19. When the curry paste is nice and fragrant, about 1 to 2 mins later, add 3 tablespoons of Shaoxing Huatiao wine.",
        "20. Add 400ml of coconut cream. Every brand of coconut cream is different. Some are thicker than others. But dont add water at this point. And dont use coconut milk instead of cream or light coconut milk. Its not the same.",
        "21. Add 1 tablespoon of oyster sauce.",
        "22. Add 1 tablespoon of sugar. Stir well to combine and leave to simmer on a low heat. The sauce will get very thick. Dont add water here because when the fish is placed in to cook, it will introduce alot of moisture to the sauce.",
        "23. When the sauce has been simmering gently for 2 to 3 mins, taste the sauce. Adjust the taste here because every brand of oyster sauce/tamarind/wine is different and the sauce needs to be fine tuned accordingly. If its too sour, add a little more sugar. If it tastes flat, add a little wine and oyster sauce. Stir well to combine.",
        "24. When the sauce is ready, gently add the fish into the pan. Keep the stove at medium heat and let the fish cook slowly in the sauce. Try not to handle the fish too much in the sauce as it will cause the fish to flake or break up.",
        "25. As the fish cooks, it will release moisture into the sauce and thin it out. Gently cover the fish with the sauce. Cover the pan and let it simmer till the fish is cooked through. It usually takes about 5 to 8 minutes depending on the thickness of the fish.",
        "26. When the fish is cooked, add the red capsicum strips and gently stir through till they are warmed through but not cooked till soft. If the sauce is too thick at this point, add a couple of tablespoons of water and stir well to combine.",
        "27. Dish out the fish curry gently because the fish may flake or break up.",
        "28. Garnish with coriander leaves."

For the first time ever, I used those frozen boneless skinless bags of chicken. NOT BAD! Also, I have never been one to cook with soups before: have learned my lesson. Once cooked in this recipe, you cannot tell there is canned soup as base for sauce.NOTES : I think this could be made in oven or on top of stove. Hint: Rival's recipe called for 4 ounces of mushrooms, but I doubled the quantity. You could leave them out if you don't like mushrooms. I had no Cream of Chicken soup and sub'd Cream of Celery. It was so good that I think I'll just stick with Celery in the future!!"

        "4. Cut the links length-wise then chop into half-moons.",
        "5. Sautee in a separate pan until the are nice and browned. Don't put into the pot until the last minute, otherwise the color of the chorizo will leach into the soup turning it a weird red color.",
        "6. Now it's time to prepare the kale. With each individual leaf, cut out the stem. You can do this several ways.",
        "7. Cut a triangle out of the leaf, or fold over the leaf and cut out the stem that way. Or rip off the halves of the leaves off the stem. I like a little bit of stem to give some crunch and texture.",
        "8. Tightly roll the leaf into a bundle.",
        "9. Run your knife over it to julienne the leaf into thin strips.",
        "10. Don't worry if it's not perfect. Set aside the kale.",
        "11. In a big pot, sautee your onions, carrots and garlic in a bit of olive oil.",
        "12. Once the vegetables start to soften, add the potatoes and some crushed red pepper flakes. Stir the pot and cook the potatoes until the outer edges start turning clear.",
        "13. Then add the 6 cups of water and 2 bouillion packets (or 4 cups of broth and 2 cups of water) to the pot. Bring to a boil then let simmer until the potatoes are cooked.",
        "14. With a wooden spoon, mash the potatoes against the side of the pot. Do this until almost all the chunks of potatoes are mashed. Leave some chunks behind. This will give your soup a wonderful hearty texture.",
        "15. Now it's time to add the Kale. It looks like a lot and will fill up your whole pot but not to worry because it wilts down pretty quickly.",
        "16. Cook for 5 minutes at a simmer then stir in chorizo sausage.",
        "17. Serve hot or at room temperature (the latter is my favorite). Eat with a nice crusty loaf of Portuguese bread. Enjoy!"

Put about 1 cup of bread crumbs in another bowl and season with a little garlic powder. Take your floured chicken and dip into the egg wash, coating all over, then into the bread crumbs. Bread all four chicken breasts.",
        "3. Put the chicken into the skillet and cook for three minutes on each side, or until golden brown on each side.",
        "4. Remove the chicken to a baking sheet. Finish the chicken in the 350 degree oven for 10-15 minutes. {Depending on how thick your chicken breasts, add more or less time.}In a large pot, boil the water needed for your pasta. We used angel hair which only takes 3-5 minutes to cook. But if youre using a penne or something denser youll need more time for the pasta.Pull the chicken out and top with mozzarella cheese, put back into the oven to melt the cheese.Plate the pasta first, topped with chicken and the cover with sauce. If youre feeling zesty add a little fresh shaved Pecorino-Romano or grated Parmesan cheese!"

Discard any with broken shells.Soak them in cool clean water for at least an hour. Mussels are alive and breathing and have taken in sand over time. This allows them to expel the sand.Mussels have a small fibrous \"beard\" that should be removed. Pull it out toward the hinge of the shell to keep from injuring the mussel.",

Give it a good stir, cover the pot, and cook until mussels open and are cooked through, 10 to 15 minutes. Divide the mussels and the juices between 2 bowls and serve with a crusty whole-grain bread to sop up that wonderful sauce."

Slowly whisk in the polenta, whisking continuously until there are no lumps and it begins to thicken slightly. Reduce the heat to medium-low and allow the polenta to simmer for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally to keep it from overcooking.When the polenta has thickened and become tender, stir in the goat cheese and cream cheese. Stir until the cheese are melted and fully incorporated into the polenta.",
        "2. Add salt and pepper to taste.Meanwhile, place the bacon on a parchment-lined baking sheet and place in the preheated oven on the middle rack. Roast for 15-18 minutes or until the bacon is golden and crisp. When it is done, remove it from the oven and place the bacon strips on a paper towel-lined plate. Set aside.In a small saucepan or in the microwave, heat the marinara sauce until just simmering. Keep warm until you are ready to assemble your bowls.In a large non-stick skillet, heat the 1 T olive oil over medium heat. If your pan is large enough, add the four eggs and allow them to cook until the whites are opaque but still a bit runny on the top. Put a lid over the pan and turn off the heat. Allow the eggs to continue cooking under the lid until the whites are set but the yolk is still runny. If your pan is small, fry the eggs in batches.To assemble the bowls, spoon even amounts of polenta in each bowl. Top with a spoonful of the arrabiata, 1 egg and 2 slices of bacon.",

As meat begins to brown, add the wine, I like to let the wine cook and bubble for about a minute to evaporate a bit. Next, add the lentils, carrots, beef stock, water and parmigiano rind. Cover the pot and set to a low simmer for 40 minutes (stirring every 10 minutes). Lastly, add the mushrooms, swiss chard, spinach and arugula. Stir and get ready to enjoy!",

        "14. To roll pasta dough, set the smooth rollers of a pasta machine at the widest setting.  (If you don't have a pasta roller, you can use a rolling pin; it'll just take some elbow grease and you may not be able to get it very thin.)",
        "15. Divide the dough into 3 pieces, flatten one piece into a rough rectangle, and cover the remaining pieces with an inverted bowl.",
        "16. Dust the rectangle with flour and feed it through the rollers.",
        "17. Turn the dial down one notch and feed the dough through the rollers.",
        "18. Continue to feed the dough through the rollers, turning the dial one notch lower each time, until the dough has reached the desired thinness.",
        "19. The dough should be a smooth, long sheet about four or five inches wide and about 1/16-inch thick.",
        "20. Roll the remaining pasta dough in the same manner.",
        "21. Using a knife, cut the sheets of pasta into 1-inch wide ribbons.",
        "22. Once you have all your tagliatelle cut, cook in a large pot of boiling, salted water.  Fresh pasta only takes a couple of minutes to cook, and it's done when it floats to the top, so be sure that you've already set the table and are ready to eat.",
        "23. Drain the cooked pasta (don't rinse!!) and divide into large pasta bowls.",
        "24. Cover the pasta with sauce and sprinkle with some freshly grated Parmiggiano Reggiano cheese.",
        "25. Serve with crusty grilled bread and a simple side salad."

Since, 1 can is a little too bean-heavy, save about 1/3 of the beans for something else.Slice the kielbasa on a steep bias into 1/4 slices.",

        "5. Add them to the skillet and cook for about 1 minute.",
        "6. Add the mustard and cream to the skillet and stir to combine.  Reduce the heat to medium low and add the brussels sprouts and beans (as many as you want to use).  Toss everything together to coat, then season to taste with a generous amount of salt and black pepper.Plate the kielbasa on top of your brussels sprouts and beans in a large bowl to serve."

Reduce heat to low and simmer 30 minutes.Check the lentils to see level of doneness  they should be soft, but should maintain their shape.  Allow soup to cook an additional 15 minutes so that the lentils can sop up more liquid.10 minutes before serving the soup, add the chopped meat. Remember it is smoked so it is already cooked all the way through  we are simply heating it up.When lentils are fully cooked and the flavors have come together, remove the thigh bone, bay leaf, thyme sprigs and serve in large heaping bowls.Grate desired amount of parmigiano reggiano on top and enjoy!"

        "2. Strain out and immediately refresh in very cold water.",
        "3. Drain, place in a deep beaker and whizz till smooth using an immersion blender. Set aside.",
        "4. Place the milk to heat in a small sauce pan while in another pan you cook the butter and flour, whisking them together to make the base.When the milk comes to the boil take both pans off the heat and pour all the milk at once onto the base, whisking hard with a large whisk to blend the two into a smooth and lump free white sauce. Should lump forms don't worry, just strain the white sauce through a sieve.Season with salt or if you prefer with plenty of freshly grated nutmeg and about 20g of grated Parmigiano-Reggiano.To pre-cook the Pasta:Prepare a wide shallow pan into which you place cold milk to come about an inch high.Cook just 2 or 3 pasta pieces at a time in salted boiling water to which you have added a little oil, for 2/3 minutes if the pasta is freshly made.",
        "5. Remove with a slotted spoon and place in the pan with the milk to stop the cooking. Then take out, let the milk drip off and place to dry on clean tea towels on your work surface. Turn them over to dry both sides",
        "6. To fill and assemble the Rosette:Prepare a buttered baking dish and pre-heat the oven to 200 C ( 90  F).",
        "7. Spread a thin layer of bchamel on the pasta pieces, then sprinkle with grated P-R. cheese and place ham and cheese slices on top",
        "8. Roll up each in piece into a cylinder and cut into two or three even sized rolls between 3 and 6 cm high as you prefer.",
        "9. Place them close together cut side up in the buttered baking dish continuing the process till it is full - if you have space left use crumpled balls of cooking foil to fill in the space and keep the rolls upright.I like to use kitchen scissors to nick the rolls in a few places and pulls out pasta \"petals\" turning them down a little so they stay \"open\" during baking.Melt 2 tbsp butter and drizzle this over the top of the roses, or to save calories, simply brush the tops with milk using a pastry brush or a couple of rolled up sheets of strong kitchen paper. You can also sprinkle with extra just-grated Reggiano if you like.",
        "10. Bake at 200 C for about 30 minutes or till the top of the roses is crisp and golden then serve placing vertically or horizontally on individual plates as you prefer.Variations: Leave the vegetables out altogether for the traditional recipe or use alternative vegetables, in a puree as above or simply placed on top of the ham.  According to what is in season, cooked mushrooms, asparagus, leeks, fennel, artichokes, blanched Swiss Chard leaves all work well.."

First, wash the rice accordingly and soak for at least 30 minutes - this step is to ensure a smoother consistency for the congee.Meanwhile, marinate the prawns.Boil the soaked rice together with the water/broth and unchopped ginger in a large pot, once brought to a boil, turn the heat lower to medium low and let boil until it reaches congee consistency. There is really no hard and fast rule for the consistency of the congee, it really depends on personal preferences, add more or less rice according to desire.Once you have achieved the consistency you desire, drop the marinated prawns in and watch closely.I only boiled the prawns for about 2-3 minutes to ensure that they didn't get overcooked - remember that the prawns will continue to 'cook' in the hot congee even after the heat is turned off.Ladle into individual bowls, and add as much green onions, ginger as you like - add dashes of soy, sesame oil and white pepper to your liking. Congee to me is best served piping, tongue-burningly hot!"

Then, sprinkle in the Cajun seasoning mix and bring to a boil.",

Each of these substitutions will add an extra dimension of flavor.*3 If you want to shred the pork, it is easiest to do when the pork is hot. Use two forks to pull the pork apart and shred. If you want to slice the pork (like for sandwiches) it is best to do when the pork is cold.",
        "4. Let the pork rest in the refrigerator for several hours or over night. Slice with a serrated knife or a very sharp chef knife."

        "1. * Note: Although this is an easy, straightforward recipe, be sure to use the ham hock or ham bone. I have tested this soup without it and find that without the bone and the meat, it is not really worth making. If you cannot find a smoked ham hock (usually found in the freezer section) and you do not have any cooked ham available, use bone-in smoked ham. (If you want a really meaty soup, use 2 pounds instead of 1.)Cook the bacon in 6-quart stock pot or Dutch oven and drain on paper towels.",
        "2. Remove all but 1 tablespoon of bacon fat and then add the olive oil and butter. Over medium heat, cook until foam subsides and then add the onion and cook over medium-low heat, stirring frequently for 15 to 20 minutes until onions are dark brown and have caramelized.",
        "3. Add the garlic, celery and carrots and cook, stirring frequently, for 5 minutes or until carrots have softened.",
        "4. Add the remaining ingredients except the salt and pepper and bring to a simmer over high heat. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer gently for about 1 1/2 hours, until peas fall apart and soup is thick.",
        "5. Remove and discard the bay leaf.",
        "6. Remove the ham bones, trim off any meat, and return the meat to the pot, discarding the bones.",
        "7. Whisk soup until smooth. Taste and adjust seasonings. (The ham is salty and therefore it is unlikely you will need to add salt.) Crumble bacon and sprinkle on individual servings.This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings."

The cooking time will not only depend on your oven, but also on how thick the salmon fillets are.While the salmon is baking you can make the sauce.To make the sauce, melt the butter in a heavy bottomed pan.  Not a non-stick pan.",
        "7. Add the flour and mix it, using a metal whisk,  until it is covered with the butter (a few seconds)",
        "8. Add about half third of the milk, whisk vigorously, it will be lumpy, don't worry.Once this is thickened into a mass, add the other half and whisk until smooth.Turn the heat down to low, add the mustard and parsley with a little salt and mix it through with a wooden spoon, let it sauce simmer very gently for a few minutes.If at any point you feel the sauce is too thick, add a little bit of milk.Check for seasoning and serve."

        "6. Then, add the onions, carrots, celery, and potato to the pot and cook for medium heat for 8 minutes, or until the vegetables begin to soften. Again, stir occasionally. In the last 30 - 60 seconds, add in the garlic, dried thyme, dried basil, and red pepper flakes.",
        "7. Now add in the canned tomatoes, chicken broth, and a bay leaf. Give it a quick stir and season with salt and pepper. Don't season too aggressively, because the pancetta and chicken broth already have salt. You can add more later on, if necessary!",
        "8. Bring the soup to a boil over high heat. Once boiling, lower to medium and simmer uncovered for 10-12 minutes.",
        "9. Then add in the dry quinoa and cook for another 15 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender and the quinoa is cooked.",
        "10. Now discard the bay leaf and add in the beans, white wine, and pesto.",
        "11. Remove the soup from the heat and stir in the baby spinach.",
        "12. Re-season with salt and pepper and place back on the stove to warm it back up, if necessary!",
        "13. Serve immediately with an optional sprinkle of shredded parmesan cheese and a side of crusty baguette smothered in pesto!"
