Using your fingers, gently break up the egg yolks as you incorporate the flour, little by little, into the egg mixture. When the dough has not yet come together, add 1 tablespoon olive oil.

One by one, guide the dough through the pasta machine, starting at the widest setting, going down to the second-to-last notch.You should now have four long sheets of past dough. Take about 1 1/2 tablespoons of veggie filling, and place it 2 inches from the edge of the dough. Repeat this all along the edge of the sheet, keeping the filling mounds about 2 inches away from each other. Fold the sheet on top of itself, so the filling is now covered. Using a pizza-cutter (or ravioli-cutter if you have one), cut between the filling, creating individual ravioli. Trim the edges to create a straight edge. Repeat with the remaining three sheets of dough. If dough is not sticking together, gently brush edges with an egg wash.Cook the ravioli in boiling water for about two minutes. Strain tomato broth and ladle into a bowl, and  top with ravioli.","3.

Pasta","2. Start by sifting the flour onto the surface. ","3. Create a well on top of the flour and crack an egg into it. ","4. Also, lightly whisk two egg yolks in a small bowl and have them ready. ","5. Add the salt into the well and start mixing carefully with a fork, trying to keep the egg from running out of the well. ","6. Once the first egg is mostly incorporated into the flour, add the olive oil and the two egg yolks. ","7. At this point, I like to use a food scraper to help work the flour toward the center to mix the dough until the egg yolks are mostly absorbed. ","8. Next, sprinkle some flour into your hands and knead for about 3 minutes.","9. Wrap in cling wrap and let rest at room temperature for about 30 minutes.","10. Next, cut the dough into quarters. ","11. Flatten each piece of dough slightly by pressing down with the palm of your hand and form it into a rectangular shape that will fit the width of the machine. ","12. Set the rollers to the widest setting and roll the dough through. Keep rolling the dough through the pasta maker, passing it through each setting twice. Keep decreasing the setting until reaching your desired thickness. In the case of ravioli, you want to make sure to get to the smallest, thinnest setting, as the dough will be doubled when you fold it over. ","13. Spinach Ricotta (and Parmesan cheese) Filling","14. Use a pan that’s large enough to fit the fresh spinach.","15. Heat olive oil over medium heat and add the spinach.","16. Within a couple minutes – while stirring occasionally – your fresh spinach will shrink from a couple handfuls to less than a cup. ","17. When the spinach is cooked down, place in a colander and squeeze out as much water as you can. In addition to that, I place the spinach onto some paper towels to remove some more moisture.","18. Finely chop the spinach. ","19. Place the spinach in a bowl, together with the ricotta, Parmesan, salt, and pepper, and mix it all together.","20. Taste and add more salt and/or pepper if necessary. The way your filling tastes right now is pretty much how your ravioli (without sauce) will taste. ","21. How to Make Homemade Ravioli","22. Place about 2 teaspoon of filling on the bottom half of the dough sheet. Leave about 1-½” of space between each scoop of filling. ","23. Lightly spritz the long edge of the dough with water. This will help the dough to stick to itself when you fold it. ","24. Fold the dough in half. ","25. Gently press down around each scoop of filling, trying to remove as much air as possible. This will help the ravioli cook more evenly. ","26. Next, use a knife or one of those cool ravioli wheels to cut the raviolis.","27. Sage Butter Sauce","28. Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over low-medium heat. The butter will begin to bubble after a minute or so. ","29. Add salt, pepper, and sage and continue stirring and cooking for another 1 to 2 minutes until the butter turns a light brown. Taste it (careful, it will be very hot). It should have a rich, nutty flavor. ","30. Putting it all together","31. Cook ravioli in regular salted pasta water, brought to a boil, making sure not to crowd them too much or they’ll cook unevenly. As they only take a few minutes to cook, make them in batches if needed. ","32. Because these homemade ravioli are pretty delicate when cooked, I recommend using a handy food spider to remove them from the pasta pot instead of draining them in a colander.","33. Drizzle sage butter sauce over the ravioli.","34.
