      "instructions": [
        "1. Buy a nice thick cut of white fish. You can use snapper, dory, kingklip or hake.",
        "2. I like to cut away the belly because its alot thinner in thickness.",
        "3. Cut the steak portion into large chunks. They will shrink when cooked, so dont cut too small a piece.",
        "4. I dont waste the belly parts. I like to roll them up. And then tie the roll of belly fish meat with a single strand of chive, so that it will look as chunky as the rest of the fish meat.",
        "5. Set aside the prepared fish.",
        "6. Prepare the red capsicum. Slice off one end.",
        "7. And then slice off the other end. This will give you a tube. Slide a knife around the inside walls of the red capsicum.",
        "8. Remove the inner seeds and membrane. Slice the hollow tube of red capsicum into half and then slice into thin strips.",
        "9. Grate or mince some peeled ginger to get approximately 1 tablespoon of ginger.",
        "10. Prepare a handful of spices/herbs  2 stalks of lemon grass, 10 lime leaves and a handful of curry leaves.",
        "11. Add 2 tablespoons of cooking oil to a pan.",
        "12. When the oil is hot, add 3 tablespoons of red curry paste of your choice.",
        "13. I always use the A1 brand from Singapore. Find a good curry paste that works for you where you are, and then stock your larder with it!",
        "14. Stir fry the paste in the hot pan for a minute.",
        "15. Add the ginger.",
        "16. Add the garlic. Stir fry well to combine.",
        "17. Add the lemon grass, lime leaves and curry leaves. Stir well to combine.",
        "18. Add 1 tablespoon of tamarind paste. Stir well to combine and dissolve the tamarind.",
        "19. When the curry paste is nice and fragrant, about 1 to 2 mins later, add 3 tablespoons of Shaoxing Huatiao wine.",
        "20. Add 400ml of coconut cream. Every brand of coconut cream is different. Some are thicker than others. But dont add water at this point. And dont use coconut milk instead of cream or light coconut milk. Its not the same.",
        "21. Add 1 tablespoon of oyster sauce.",
        "22. Add 1 tablespoon of sugar. Stir well to combine and leave to simmer on a low heat. The sauce will get very thick. Dont add water here because when the fish is placed in to cook, it will introduce alot of moisture to the sauce.",
        "23. When the sauce has been simmering gently for 2 to 3 mins, taste the sauce. Adjust the taste here because every brand of oyster sauce/tamarind/wine is different and the sauce needs to be fine tuned accordingly. If its too sour, add a little more sugar. If it tastes flat, add a little wine and oyster sauce. Stir well to combine.",
        "24. When the sauce is ready, gently add the fish into the pan. Keep the stove at medium heat and let the fish cook slowly in the sauce. Try not to handle the fish too much in the sauce as it will cause the fish to flake or break up.",
        "25. As the fish cooks, it will release moisture into the sauce and thin it out. Gently cover the fish with the sauce. Cover the pan and let it simmer till the fish is cooked through. It usually takes about 5 to 8 minutes depending on the thickness of the fish.",
        "26. When the fish is cooked, add the red capsicum strips and gently stir through till they are warmed through but not cooked till soft. If the sauce is too thick at this point, add a couple of tablespoons of water and stir well to combine.",
        "27. Dish out the fish curry gently because the fish may flake or break up.",
        "28. Garnish with coriander leaves."

Uncover the skillet and cook another 2 minutes, the cauliflower will be al dente. (If there is liquid pooled in the skillet at all make sure you let it evaporate, I didn't have this problem, but you want the cauliflower to not be wet.)",
        "3. Remove from heat and set aside to cool at least 10 minutes.Meanwhile, preheat oven to 200 degrees. When cauliflower has cooled, add to a large bowl along with minced onion, Parmesan and cheddar cheeses, egg and egg yolk, parsley, paprika, a few grindings of fresh black pepper and panko breadcrumbs.",
        "4. Mix well. If the mixture seems too loose to make patties, add more breadcrumbs, a tablespoon or two at a time until the mix holds together better.Using a measuring cup, scoop out 1/3 c. portions and firmly pat into a patty shape. Set patties aside on a plate. You should have about 8 patties.Wipe out the skillet used to cook the cauliflower.",
        "5. Place back on the burner at medium-high heat.",
        "6. Add 2 T. vegetable oil to the skillet and heat until  the oil starts to shimmer. Carefully lay half the patties in the hot oil and cook until golden brown about 2 minutes per side, being careful that they don't fall apart when you flip them.",
        "7. Remove to a paper towel-lined baking sheet and place into the oven to keep warm. Wipe out the skillet then repeat this step with the remaining oil and cauliflower cakes.",
        "8. Serve hot."

Put about 1 cup of bread crumbs in another bowl and season with a little garlic powder. Take your floured chicken and dip into the egg wash, coating all over, then into the bread crumbs. Bread all four chicken breasts.",

Finish the chicken in the 350 degree oven for 10-15 minutes. {Depending on how thick your chicken breasts, add more or less time.}In a large pot, boil the water needed for your pasta. We used angel hair which only takes 3-5 minutes to cook. But if youre using a penne or something denser youll need more time for the pasta.Pull the chicken out and top with mozzarella cheese, put back into the oven to melt the cheese.Plate the pasta first, topped with chicken and the cover with sauce. If youre feeling zesty add a little fresh shaved Pecorino-Romano or grated Parmesan cheese!"

Using tongs, roast the jalapeo and wrapped garlic over a flame (I used my gas stove) until the flesh is blackened, soft and hot.  When cool enough to handle, remove the stem and seeds from the jalapeo.",

The flipping process requires some finess, as these pull apart easily  they take a little more care than the standard pancake. Spoon out small portions of batter into the skillet (you should be able to make 3 at a time) and allow pancakes to cook about 5 to 7 minutes before flipping.  Allow pancake to cook an additional 3 minutes and serve with your favorite toppings!Makes about 6 pancakes. Serving size is 3 pancakes per person."

Depending on the size of the chicken breasts, this could take anywhere from 15 - 20 minutes.While the chicken is boiling, put together your sauce.",

If you're worried about the cashews getting too soft, you could add them right before serving!After the chicken is done boiling, I like to let it rest for about 5 minutes. This ensures that the juice stays in the chicken instead of spilling out when you cut it!Dice up the chicken and mix it into the sauce.",

Reduce heat to low and simmer 30 minutes.Check the lentils to see level of doneness  they should be soft, but should maintain their shape.  Allow soup to cook an additional 15 minutes so that the lentils can sop up more liquid.10 minutes before serving the soup, add the chopped meat. Remember it is smoked so it is already cooked all the way through  we are simply heating it up.When lentils are fully cooked and the flavors have come together, remove the thigh bone, bay leaf, thyme sprigs and serve in large heaping bowls.Grate desired amount of parmigiano reggiano on top and enjoy!"

Drop in the diced celery, carrot, cucumber and grapes and mix well. Once all the ingredients have been combined, add additional mayonnaise if you prefer a wetter consistency to the salad.Once the consistency is right, add in curry powder and turmeric powder. These are they key ingredients, so make sure you are using high quality spices. Start with a small amount of each spice and gradually add to taste - the measurements here are just recommendations, you should taste test as you go along. If possible, pop your mixing bowl into the fridge for an hour to let the flavors marry.",

        "1. First, wash the rice accordingly and soak for at least 30 minutes - this step is to ensure a smoother consistency for the congee.Meanwhile, marinate the prawns.Boil the soaked rice together with the water/broth and unchopped ginger in a large pot, once brought to a boil, turn the heat lower to medium low and let boil until it reaches congee consistency. There is really no hard and fast rule for the consistency of the congee, it really depends on personal preferences, add more or less rice according to desire.Once you have achieved the consistency you desire, drop the marinated prawns in and watch closely.I only boiled the prawns for about 2-3 minutes to ensure that they didn't get overcooked - remember that the prawns will continue to 'cook' in the hot congee even after the heat is turned off.Ladle into individual bowls, and add as much green onions, ginger as you like - add dashes of soy, sesame oil and white pepper to your liking. Congee to me is best served piping, tongue-burningly hot!"

Make sure the roux doesn't stick to the bottom of the pan, so add more oil if you need to.Now, add the stock to deglaze the pot for a couple of minutes. Then, sprinkle in the Cajun seasoning mix and bring to a boil.",

        "1. Firstly, to cook the shrimp, heat the olive oil in a pan and once hot add the shrimp crushed garlic and chili flakes. It is important to get the oil nice and hot (not smoking, just before that point) your shrimp should sizzle when added to the pan. Check the back of the shrimp and when you see the colour change about half way up, turn them over. Do the same on the other side. This should only take a minute to two minutes maximum on both sides  otherwise you will get a rubbery result if you leave it too long. Squeeze over the lime juice  this too should bubble and reduce.",

        "3. Mix the dressing ingredients together, check for flavour, adjust if need be and set aside.",
        "4. Place all the salad ingredients in a bowl except the avocado and the salt and pepper. Prepare the avocado as you are about to serve otherwise it will turn brown. Once it is covered in the lime dressing, this will slow down the oxidization process and it wont go brown so easily.",
        "5. When you are ready to serve mix  of the avocado through the salad and add the dressing. Toss everything together. Taste to see if you need any salt and pepper.",
        "6. Place your shrimp on top of the salad with the rest of the avocado and sprinkle/pour any residue from the pan over your salad in which you cooked the shrimp. This is great flavour, so you dont want to lose it."

        "3. Next, dice some yellow onion and mince some garlic.",
        "4. Throw the olive oil in a large stock (or soup) pot and let it warm up over medium heat.",
        "5. Once warm, add in the pancetta and cook over medium heat for 5 minutes. Stir occasionally, until lightly browned.",
        "6. Then, add the onions, carrots, celery, and potato to the pot and cook for medium heat for 8 minutes, or until the vegetables begin to soften. Again, stir occasionally. In the last 30 - 60 seconds, add in the garlic, dried thyme, dried basil, and red pepper flakes.",
        "7. Now add in the canned tomatoes, chicken broth, and a bay leaf. Give it a quick stir and season with salt and pepper. Don't season too aggressively, because the pancetta and chicken broth already have salt. You can add more later on, if necessary!",
        "8. Bring the soup to a boil over high heat. Once boiling, lower to medium and simmer uncovered for 10-12 minutes.",
        "9. Then add in the dry quinoa and cook for another 15 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender and the quinoa is cooked.",
        "10. Now discard the bay leaf and add in the beans, white wine, and pesto.",
        "11. Remove the soup from the heat and stir in the baby spinach.",
        "12. Re-season with salt and pepper and place back on the stove to warm it back up, if necessary!",
        "13. Serve immediately with an optional sprinkle of shredded parmesan cheese and a side of crusty baguette smothered in pesto!"

Cook until the artichoke hearts are warmed through, then remove from pan to a bowl and set aside.2 In a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs and the cottage cheese. In a small bowl, whisk together the flour, Parmesan, and baking powder.",
        "3. Add the flour mixture to the egg mixture and whisk. Stir the artichokes and leeks into the egg mixture. Note that the color of the mixture may change, don't worry if this happens, it will go back to normal when cooked. 3 Wipe out the pan with a paper towel. Then melt another tablespoon of butter into the pan on medium heat, and swirl along the bottom and sides to coat well.",
        "4. Pour the egg mixture into the pan, swirling to make sure the artichokes and leeks are evenly distributed. Lower the heat. Cover the pan, slowly cook on the stove top for 12 to 15 minutes, until all but the center has set. You'll need to check every few minutes. The heat should be high enough to set the mixture, but low enough so that the edges don't brown. This frittata benefits from slow, gentle cooking. 4",
        "5. Place rack in upper third of oven. Preheat the broiler. When the frittata is mostly set, except for the center which is still wiggly, place the pan in the oven. Broil for 3 to 4 minutes until the top is lightly browned and the center has set.5",
        "6. Remove pan from oven. (Be careful about the hot handle! Use a pot holder. I like to run an ice cube over the handle to to be extra safe.) Use a blunt knife or a metal spatula to loosen the edges of the frittata from the pan. Gently insert the spatula under the frittata to loosen it from the bottom of the pan. Then gently slide the frittata onto a serving plate.",
