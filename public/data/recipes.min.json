I begin with my bacon (Ive never had bacon this fresh before, from an entirely organic source so close to home that my husband is literally feeding next seasons pork belly), which I chop and try out to nice crispy cubelets.  Now the rest of the meal will take less than 25 minutes: 10 minutes to boil the pasta, make the sauce, and assemble the dish (and, if youre like me, some sub-urb biscuits), and 15 minutes to bake it (while you make  a quick salad).  So be ready.","2. I melt my butter in my wok over high heat.  I throw my pasta nests into the salted boiling water on the back burner.","3. When my butter is melted and just begging to tan, I add my heavy cream and blend well.  I bring this to a simmer for a moment.","4. Then I add 3/4 of my cheese, which Ive shredded. (The rest I will thinly shave for a final garnish.)","5. I blend this well, bringing it to a low simmer to thicken, until it forms a smooth sauce.  I also add some salt and pepper.  (Crushed red pepper flakes, nutmeg, paprika, maybe even a dash of curry powder would work nicely here, too.)","6. Finally, I add 3/4 of my cooked bacon, and blend well with the sauce, until the flavors are beautifully infused.","7. Its  been 10 minutes, and my 11 minute pasta is just slightly undercooked (I know, cuz I bit off a snippet)  perfect!  Using tongs and a meshed spoon, I transfer my pasta to the waiting bacon cream, and toss well.  I add a tablespoon, maybe, of the pasta water, too, just to keep the sauce wet enough to bake later.","8. Using my tongs, I spin 1/2 of the pasta and sauce into each of two medium (10oz) ceramic ramekins, which Ive brushed down with melted butter.  I sprinkle most of the rest of my bacon (reserving a few chunks for a final flourish) on top.","9. The piece of resistance: a whole, cracked, raw egg, dropped into a wee basket I left in the middle of my pasta and sauce nests.  I manage to keep the yolk whole only in one, but the other I rather hold together by virtue of a cleverly placed noodle and some dribbled sauce.  I place these into a 350 oven to bake for 15 minutes, or until the whites have set, but the yolk is still glossy and runny.","10. After coring the best bits out of a loaf of bread destined for nothing (since my husband purchased a fresher loaf of preferred pan this afternoon) with a properly sized wine-glass rim, I brushed each disk with melted butter, and layered them with some of my sprinkled cheese into 4 cups of a buttered muffin tin, and then I stuck them in my oven along with my pasta nests to brown.  I consider these my sub-urb Wonderbread biscuits: quick, easy, and yummy, leaving fodder for crotons (or compost).  I also threw together a quick salad of baby greens, sliced onion, strips of roasted red peppers, black olives, EVOO, and salt and pepper.

Add 1 tablespoon of oyster sauce.","22. Add 1 tablespoon of sugar. Stir well to combine and leave to simmer on a low heat. The sauce will get very thick. Dont add water here because when the fish is placed in to cook, it will introduce alot of moisture to the sauce.","23. When the sauce has been simmering gently for 2 to 3 mins, taste the sauce. Adjust the taste here because every brand of oyster sauce/tamarind/wine is different and the sauce needs to be fine tuned accordingly. If its too sour, add a little more sugar. If it tastes flat, add a little wine and oyster sauce. Stir well to combine.","24. When the sauce is ready, gently add the fish into the pan. Keep the stove at medium heat and let the fish cook slowly in the sauce. Try not to handle the fish too much in the sauce as it will cause the fish to flake or break up.","25. As the fish cooks, it will release moisture into the sauce and thin it out. Gently cover the fish with the sauce. Cover the pan and let it simmer till the fish is cooked through.

When the fish is cooked, add the red capsicum strips and gently stir through till they are warmed through but not cooked till soft.

Season the boar with salt and pepper and dust with a bit of flour.","2. Brown the boar on both sides and set aside.","3. In another pan, heat a couple of tablespoons of olive oil until almost smoking.","4. Add the onions and cook until translucent.","5. Add the garlic and cook a couple minutes longer before adding the carrot and celery.","6. Cook until the vegetables are soft.","7. Add the boar and pancetta to the pot and cook for about 10-15 minutes.","8. Add the tomatoes, wine, parsley and basil.","9. Simmer for several hours if you can, stirring occasionally.","10. After a couple of hours, start trying to pull apart the boar meat.  (Leaving it in large pieces will make it dry.)  You should be able to do this just with a wooden spoon.","11. In a food processor blend the flour, the eggs, the oil, and 1 1/2 tablespoons cold water until the mixture just begins to form a ball, adding more water drop by drop if the dough is too dry.  (The dough should be firm and not sticky.)","12. Blend the dough for 15 seconds more to knead it.","13. You can prepare the dough up to 4 hours ahead of time.  Just keep it covered in the fridge.  It needs to stand, covered, at room temperature for an hour before being rolled, however, so keep that in mind.","14. To roll pasta dough, set the smooth rollers of a pasta machine at the widest setting.  (If you don't have a pasta roller, you can use a rolling pin; it'll just take some elbow grease and you may not be able to get it very thin.)","15. Divide the dough into 3 pieces, flatten one piece into a rough rectangle, and cover the remaining pieces with an inverted bowl.","16. Dust the rectangle with flour and feed it through the rollers.","17. Turn the dial down one notch and feed the dough through the rollers.","18. Continue to feed the dough through the rollers, turning the dial one notch lower each time, until the dough has reached the desired thinness.","19. The dough should be a smooth, long sheet about four or five inches wide and about 1/16-inch thick.","20. Roll the remaining pasta dough in the same manner.","21. Using a knife, cut the sheets of pasta into 1-inch wide ribbons.","22. Once you have all your tagliatelle cut, cook in a large pot of boiling, salted water.  Fresh pasta only takes a couple of minutes to cook, and it's done when it floats to the top, so be sure that you've already set the table and are ready to eat.","23. Drain the cooked pasta (don't rinse!!) and divide into large pasta bowls.","24. Cover the pasta with sauce and sprinkle with some freshly grated Parmiggiano Reggiano cheese.","25.

Should lump forms don't worry, just strain the white sauce through a sieve.Season with salt or if you prefer with plenty of freshly grated nutmeg and about 20g of grated Parmigiano-Reggiano.To pre-cook the Pasta:Prepare a wide shallow pan into which you place cold milk to come about an inch high.Cook just 2 or 3 pasta pieces at a time in salted boiling water to which you have added a little oil, for 2/3 minutes if the pasta is freshly made.","5.

Check the back of the shrimp and when you see the colour change about half way up, turn them over. Do the same on the other side. This should only take a minute to two minutes maximum on both sides  otherwise you will get a rubbery result if you leave it too long. Squeeze over the lime juice  this too should bubble and reduce.","2. Add a little salt and pepper, stir through, remove from the heat and set aside.","3.

In the case of ravioli, you want to make sure to get to the smallest, thinnest setting, as the dough will be doubled when you fold it over. ","13. Spinach Ricotta (and Parmesan cheese) Filling","14. Use a pan that’s large enough to fit the fresh spinach.","15. Heat olive oil over medium heat and add the spinach.","16. Within a couple minutes – while stirring occasionally – your fresh spinach will shrink from a couple handfuls to less than a cup. ","17. When the spinach is cooked down, place in a colander and squeeze out as much water as you can. In addition to that, I place the spinach onto some paper towels to remove some more moisture.","18. Finely chop the spinach. ","19. Place the spinach in a bowl, together with the ricotta, Parmesan, salt, and pepper, and mix it all together.","20. Taste and add more salt and/or pepper if necessary. The way your filling tastes right now is pretty much how your ravioli (without sauce) will taste. ","21. How to Make Homemade Ravioli","22. Place about 2 teaspoon of filling on the bottom half of the dough sheet. Leave about 1-½” of space between each scoop of filling. ","23. Lightly spritz the long edge of the dough with water. This will help the dough to stick to itself when you fold it. ","24. Fold the dough in half. ","25. Gently press down around each scoop of filling, trying to remove as much air as possible. This will help the ravioli cook more evenly. ","26. Next, use a knife or one of those cool ravioli wheels to cut the raviolis.","27. Sage Butter Sauce","28. Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over low-medium heat. The butter will begin to bubble after a minute or so. ","29. Add salt, pepper, and sage and continue stirring and cooking for another 1 to 2 minutes until the butter turns a light brown. Taste it (careful, it will be very hot). It should have a rich, nutty flavor. ","30. Putting it all together","31. Cook ravioli in regular salted pasta water, brought to a boil, making sure not to crowd them too much or they’ll cook unevenly. As they only take a few minutes to cook, make them in batches if needed. ","32. Because these homemade ravioli are pretty delicate when cooked, I recommend using a handy food spider to remove them from the pasta pot instead of draining them in a colander.","33. Drizzle sage butter sauce over the ravioli.","34.
