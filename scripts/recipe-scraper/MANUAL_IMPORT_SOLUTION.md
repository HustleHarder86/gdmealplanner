# Manual Recipe Import Solution - Complete Implementation

## Overview

This solution addresses the need for importing 100% real recipes for the gestational diabetes meal planning app. After attempting automated scraping (which faced technical challenges with anti-bot measures and outdated URLs), we've implemented a manual import system using a browser bookmarklet.

## Solution Components

### 1. Browser Bookmarklet (`recipe-importer-bookmarklet.js`)
- **Purpose**: Extracts recipe data from any recipe website while browsing
- **Features**:
  - Automatic JSON-LD structured data extraction
  - Fallback to microdata parsing
  - Real-time GD nutrition validation
  - Interactive UI overlay with preview
  - One-click import to app database

### 2. API Endpoint (`app/api/import-recipe/route.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Receives and processes recipe data from bookmarklet
- **Features**:
  - Validates GD nutritional requirements
  - Formats and stores recipes in appropriate category files
  - Generates unique recipe IDs
  - Logs all imports for tracking
  - CORS support for cross-origin requests

### 3. Supporting Files
- **Instructions**: `BOOKMARKLET_INSTRUCTIONS.md` - Complete user guide
- **Testing**: `test-api-endpoint.js` - API endpoint verification script

## How It Works

```
User Workflow:
1. Install bookmarklet in browser bookmarks
2. Visit any recipe website
3. Click bookmarklet while viewing a recipe
4. Review extracted data and GD validation
5. Click "Import" if recipe meets requirements
6. Recipe is automatically saved to app database

Technical Flow:
Recipe Website â†’ Bookmarklet â†’ Extract Data â†’ Validate GD â†’ API Endpoint â†’ Save to JSON files
```

## GD Validation Rules

All imported recipes must meet these requirements:
- **Carbohydrates**: 10-50g per serving
- **Protein**: Minimum 5g per serving
- **Fiber**: Minimum 2g per serving
- **Total time**: Maximum 60 minutes

## Data Structure

Recipes are automatically formatted and saved to:
- `data/recipes/breakfast.json`
- `data/recipes/lunch.json` 
- `data/recipes/dinner.json`
- `data/recipes/snacks.json`

Each recipe includes:
```json
{
  "id": "unique-recipe-id-timestamp",
  "title": "Recipe Name",
  "description": "Recipe description",
  "url": "https://source-website.com/recipe",
  "source": "source-website.com",
  "prepTime": 15,
  "cookTime": 20,
  "totalTime": 35,
  "servings": 4,
  "ingredients": [
    {
      "amount": "1",
      "unit": "cup",
      "item": "quinoa",
      "originalText": "1 cup quinoa"
    }
  ],
  "instructions": ["Step 1", "Step 2"],
  "nutrition": {
    "calories": 280,
    "carbohydrates": 32,
    "protein": 12,
    "fiber": 4,
    "fat": 8,
    "sugar": 3
  },
  "category": "lunch",
  "tags": ["imported", "gd-friendly", "30-minutes-or-less"],
  "difficulty": "easy",
  "verified": true,
  "imported_from_bookmarklet": true,
  "imported_at": "2025-01-01T12:00:00.000Z"
}
```

## Advantages of This Approach

### âœ… Benefits
1. **100% Real Recipes**: All recipes come from legitimate, existing websites
2. **User Control**: Manual review ensures quality and appropriateness
3. **No Legal Issues**: No automated scraping that might violate ToS
4. **Wide Compatibility**: Works on any recipe site with structured data
5. **GD Validation**: Automatic filtering ensures all recipes meet requirements
6. **Easy to Use**: One-click import process
7. **Tracking**: Complete log of all imported recipes

### ðŸ“ˆ Scalability
- Can import unlimited recipes from any source
- Easy to share bookmarklet with multiple users
- No rate limiting or blocking concerns
- Builds a custom, curated recipe database over time

## Supported Recipe Websites

The bookmarklet works on sites that use structured data (schema.org), including:
- AllRecipes
- Food Network
- EatingWell
- Taste of Home
- BBC Good Food
- Serious Eats
- Most food blogger sites
- Recipe aggregator sites

## Getting Started

### 1. Setup (One-time)
```bash
# Make sure your Next.js app is running
cd /home/amy/dev/gdmealplanner
npm run dev

# Test the API endpoint
node scripts/recipe-scraper/test-api-endpoint.js
```

### 2. Install Bookmarklet
1. Copy the code from `recipe-importer-bookmarklet.js`
2. Create a new bookmark in your browser
3. Paste the code as the URL

### 3. Start Importing
1. Visit any recipe website
2. Navigate to a specific recipe page
3. Click your bookmarklet
4. Review and import!

## Future Enhancements
