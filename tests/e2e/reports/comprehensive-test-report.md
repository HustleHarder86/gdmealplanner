## Technical Implementation Review

### Strengths:

3. **Bundle Size**: Could optimize recipe data loading

## Recommendations

### High Priority:
1. **Fix Initial Recipe Count**: Ensure count displays correctly on load
2. **Add Loading States**: Show spinners during async operations
3. **Implement Success Feedback**: Toast notifications for user actions

### Medium Priority:
1. **Improve Mobile UX**: Larger touch targets, better responsive design
2. **Add Analytics**: Track feature usage and performance
3. **Enhance Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages

### Low Priority:
1. **Add Animations**: Smooth transitions for better perceived performance
2. **Implement Favorites**: Let users save preferred meals
3. **Recipe Search**: Add search within dietary restrictions
